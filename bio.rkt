 #:coach-story "I joined ThoughtStem to learn basic coding so i can understand what it's all about
and to share my knowledge with my kids. Along the way, I realised that i shared their passion to teach children all about coding.
Children are like sponges; they absorb knowledge in story-form easily and retain that memory. By teaching them logical thinking
and applying that to coding, the kids are learning a life skill that will aid them as they grow older. I hope that
my Coach story will inspire both young and old, and that learning has no age limit.")
